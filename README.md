# Character Recognition

This project contains two main files:

1. **mnist_train.ipynb**: Jupyter notebook to train a CNN model on the MNIST dataset and save it as `mnist_cnn.h5`. Run this notebook in Google Colab or locally with TensorFlow installed.
2. **draw_predict.py**: Python script that opens a drawing board using Tkinter. Draw a digit, and the script will show real-time predictions and probabilities for each digit using the trained model.

## Usage

### 1. Train the Model

- Open `mnist_train.ipynb` in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Run all cells to train and save the model as `mnist_cnn.h5`.
- Download `mnist_cnn.h5` and place it in the same directory as `draw_predict.py`.

### 2. Run the Drawing Board

- Make sure you have Python 3, TensorFlow, Pillow, and NumPy installed:
  ```sh
  pip install tensorflow pillow numpy
  ```
- Run the script:
  ```sh
  python draw_predict.py
  ```
- Draw a digit on the board. The predicted digit and probabilities for all digits will be displayed.

## Files

- `mnist_train.ipynb`: Model training notebook
- `draw_predict.py`: Drawing board and prediction script
- `mnist_cnn.h5`: Saved model file (generated by the notebook)

## .gitignore

A sample `.gitignore` is included to ignore model files and Python cache.
